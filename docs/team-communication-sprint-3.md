# Sprint 3: Team Communication & Decision Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-02  
**Status**: üü° **PLANNING** - Awaiting team decisions  
**Next Meeting**: TBD - Schedule Sprint 3 kickoff

---

## üéØ **Key Strategic Decision: MVP vs. Full Scope**

### **The Question**
Our original Sprint 3 plan was ambitious (5 user stories, 4 weeks). After analysis, this is realistically **6-8 weeks of work** for production-ready implementation.

### **Team Options**

**Option A: MVP-First (4 weeks)** üéØ **RECOMMENDED**
- **Single killer feature**: AI-Enhanced Daily Brief using real email/calendar data
- **Lower risk**: One feature done exceptionally well
- **Faster feedback**: Get user validation before building more
- **Foundation**: Proves hybrid AI architecture works

**Option B: Full Scope (6 weeks)**
- **All 5 user stories**: Daily briefs, smart inbox, context suggestions, AI search, calendar management
- **Higher value**: Complete AI transformation
- **Higher risk**: Complex integration, potential delays

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- **4 weeks**: MVP + foundation
- **Post-MVP**: Iterate based on user feedback

### **Team Vote Needed** üó≥Ô∏è
**Question**: Which approach should we take?
- [ ] **A**: MVP-first (AI Daily Brief only)
- [ ] **B**: Full scope (extend to 6 weeks)
- [ ] **C**: Hybrid (MVP then iterate)

## üö® **Critical Blocker: Missing Prerequisites**

**Sprint 3 CANNOT begin until these are complete:**

### **üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY (Blocking)**
1. **Database Migrations**: New tables for OAuth tokens, AI interactions, email insights
2. **Environment Setup**: Google OAuth credentials, OpenAI API keys, cost controls
3. **Local AI Validation**: At least one team member confirms `./scripts/setup-local-ai.sh` works

### **üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (Important)**
4. **TypeScript Interfaces**: Provider data types, AI response types
5. **Feature Flags**: Basic on/off switches for AI features
6. **Error Boundaries**: AI failure handling components

**Estimated Time**: 3-5 days to complete all prerequisites  
**Responsibility**: Needs team assignment (see [sprint-3-prerequisites.md](sprint-3-prerequisites.md))

---

## üí° **MVP User Story**

**If we choose MVP approach, this is our focus:**

*"As Alex, I want my daily brief to analyze my real emails and calendar to provide actionable insights that help me start each day with clarity and focus."*

**What this includes:**
- Google OAuth integration (Gmail + Calendar read-only)
- Local AI processing for privacy (email triage, calendar analysis)
- Enhanced DailyBriefWidget with real data
- Cost controls and budget monitoring
- Hybrid AI router (local vs. cloud)

**What this excludes (Post-MVP):**
- Bidirectional sync (sending emails, creating calendar events)
- Smart context suggestions with learning
- Global AI search
- Advanced calendar management

---

## üé® **Privacy & Cost Strategy**

### **Our Differentiator: Privacy-First AI**
- **90% Local Processing**: Email and calendar content never leaves user's device
- **10% Cloud Processing**: Only for creative tasks like writing
- **Cost Target**: <$1/day per user (vs. typical $5/day cloud-only)

### **Marketing Message**
- "Your emails never leave your device"
- "AI insights without cloud surveillance"
- "Complete control over your data"

---

## üìã **Immediate Team Actions Required**

### **This Week**
1. **Team Decision**: Vote on MVP vs. Full Scope approach
2. **Prerequisite Assignment**: Divide foundation tasks among team members
3. **Environment Setup**: Everyone gets Google OAuth credentials and OpenAI access
4. **Local AI Testing**: At least 2 team members validate Ollama setup

### **Next Week**
1. **Sprint 3 Kickoff**: If prerequisites complete
2. **User Research**: Identify 3-5 Alex-persona users for testing
3. **Success Metrics**: Define how we measure MVP success

### **Risk Planning**
1. **Rollback Strategy**: Plan for disabling AI features if issues arise
2. **Fallback Content**: Design static alternatives for when AI fails
3. **Cost Monitoring**: Set up real-time budget alerts

## üìÖ **Proposed Timeline**

### **If MVP Approach**
- **Week 1**: Prerequisites + Foundation + Local AI setup
- **Week 2**: OAuth + Email/Calendar integration
- **Week 3**: AI-Enhanced Daily Brief implementation
- **Week 4**: Testing + User feedback + Polish

### **If Full Scope Approach**
- **Week 1-4**: As above (MVP)
- **Week 5**: Bidirectional features + Smart context
- **Week 6**: AI search + Advanced features + Testing

---

## üéØ **Success Definition**

**MVP Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Daily brief shows real email/calendar insights
- [ ] AI costs stay under $1/day per user
- [ ] Local AI processing works for 90% of tasks
- [ ] Users find brief helpful (subjective feedback)
- [ ] No major privacy or security issues

**Technical Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Hybrid AI router works reliably
- [ ] OAuth flow handles token refresh correctly
- [ ] Error boundaries prevent AI failures from crashing app
- [ ] Feature flags allow instant disable of problematic features

---

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Schedule team meeting** to vote on approach
2. **Assign prerequisite tasks** to team members
3. **Set completion deadline** for prerequisites (suggest: Friday)
4. **Plan Sprint 3 kickoff** for following Monday (if prerequisites complete)

**Questions for team discussion:**
- Do we have the appetite for 6-week timeline for full scope?
- Who has bandwidth for OAuth implementation work?
- Are we comfortable with local AI complexity?
- Do we have access to Alex-persona users for testing?

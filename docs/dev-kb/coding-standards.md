# Coding Standards

This document defines the coding standards for the LogOS project. All code generated by `@dev` must pass checks based on these standards, and `@qa` must enforce them during review.

## General Principles
- **Keep solutions simple and modular:** Strive for simplicity and break down complex problems into smaller, reusable modules.
- **Prefer editing over rewriting:** Evolve existing code rather than creating new solutions from scratch.
- **Don't reinvent the wheel:** Adhere to existing patterns found in the codebase and our `api-patterns.md`. Avoid introducing new, one-off patterns.
- **Never duplicate code (DRY):** Abstract reusable logic into functions, hooks, or components.
- **Write for all environments:** Be mindful of how code will behave in `development`, `test`, and `production` environments.
- **Use the terminal for one-off tasks:** Avoid creating temporary script files. Use the integrated terminal for running commands.
- **Clarity over cleverness:** Code should be easy to read and understand.
- **Strict Typing:** Use TypeScript for all new code. Avoid `any` wherever possible.

## TypeScript & React
- **Component Naming:** Components should be PascalCase (e.g., `DailyBriefWidget.tsx`).
- **Hooks:** Custom hooks should be prefixed with `use` (e.g., `useAuth.ts`).
- **Props:** Use interfaces for component props, prefixed with `I` (e.g., `IDailyBriefWidgetProps`).
- **File Structure:** Feature-based folder structure as defined in the blueprint (`/features/<n>/`).
- **Component Template:** Follow the template in `docs/stories/ux/component-template.md` for new components.

## UI & UX Standards
- **Widget Specifications:** Follow the detailed specs in `docs/stories/ux/dashboard-widgets.md`.
- **Tailwind Patterns:** Use the predefined patterns from `docs/stories/ux/tailwind-cheatsheet.md`.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all components meet the accessibility requirements defined in our UX docs.
- **Loading States:** Implement skeleton loaders and loading states as specified in the component template.
- **Error Handling:** Follow the error state patterns from our UX documentation.

## Linting
- **ESLint:** The `.eslintrc` configuration in the root directory is the single source of truth for linting rules.
- **Max Lines:** A strict 250-line limit per file is enforced, with exemptions only for configuration, generated types, and test fixtures. [[memory:3882515615031388418]]
- **CI Gate:** All code must pass `pnpm run lint` with zero warnings before being merged.

## Naming Conventions
- **Variables:** camelCase (e.g., `dailyBriefData`).
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_BASE_URL`).
- **Functions:** camelCase (e.g., `fetchDailyBrief`).
- **CSS Classes:** Use Tailwind CSS utility classes. Avoid custom CSS files where possible.
- **Class Combinations:** Follow the patterns in our Tailwind cheat sheet for common UI patterns.

## Technical Implementation

### AI Integration Architecture
```
Frontend (React) â†’ Supabase Edge Functions â†’ OpenAI API
                 â†˜ Vector Database (pgvector) â†’ Semantic Search
```

### New Supabase Functions
- `briefbot-hello` - Daily brief generation
- `ai-search` - Natural language search and intent processing
- `context-analyzer` - Real-time context awareness
- `schedule-planner` - AI-powered daily planning
- `insights-generator` - Productivity pattern analysis

### Data Models
```sql
-- AI interaction tracking
CREATE TABLE ai_interactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  interaction_type TEXT, -- 'brief', 'search', 'suggestion'
  query TEXT,
  response JSONB,
  feedback INTEGER, -- -1, 0, 1 for learning
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Productivity metrics
CREATE TABLE productivity_metrics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  metric_type TEXT, -- 'task_completion', 'focus_session'
  value NUMERIC,
  context JSONB, -- time_of_day, day_of_week, etc.
  recorded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### AI Model Strategy
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Cost-effective for brief generation and analysis
- **OpenAI text-embedding-3-small**: Semantic search and similarity
- **Fallback gracefully**: If AI fails, show helpful static content

### Performance Considerations
- Cache AI responses for 1 hour to reduce API costs
- Implement request debouncing for search
- Use streaming responses for long AI generations
- Background processing for insight calculations

---

## Sprint Review Goals
- Daily briefs provide genuinely helpful AI-generated insights
- Context ribbon suggests relevant actions that users actually click
- Global search understands natural language and finds relevant results
- Task insights reveal meaningful productivity patterns
- "Plan My Day" creates realistic, helpful daily schedules
- All AI features degrade gracefully when services are unavailable

---

## Success Metrics
- **Engagement**: >60% of users interact with AI features daily
- **Usefulness**: >70% of AI suggestions are clicked/followed
- **Search Accuracy**: >80% of searches return relevant results
- **Performance**: All AI responses complete within 3 seconds
- **Cost Efficiency**: <$0.10 per user per day in AI API costs

---

## Risk Mitigation
- **AI Reliability**: Implement fallback static content for all AI features
- **Cost Control**: Set API usage limits and monitoring alerts
- **User Trust**: Be transparent about AI limitations and allow feedback
- **Performance**: Cache aggressively and optimize API usage patterns

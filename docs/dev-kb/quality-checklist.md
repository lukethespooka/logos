# Quality Checklist

This document defines the required quality checks for all features in LogOS. It was created after Sprint 2 to ensure consistent quality across all aspects of development.

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

### Architecture & Design
- [ ] Review existing patterns in `architecture-decisions.md`
- [ ] Consider impact on future architectural plans (V4.x features)
- [ ] Plan for offline capabilities
- [ ] Define type interfaces before implementation
- [ ] Identify shared components/hooks opportunities
- [ ] Review widget specifications in `docs/stories/ux/dashboard-widgets.md`
- [ ] Check Tailwind patterns in `docs/stories/ux/tailwind-cheatsheet.md`

### Security & Performance
- [ ] Plan rate limiting strategy for new endpoints
- [ ] Consider data validation requirements
- [ ] Identify potential performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Plan caching strategy if applicable
- [ ] Review authentication requirements

## Implementation Checklist

### Component Structure
- [ ] Follow component template from `docs/stories/ux/component-template.md`
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Add loading states per UX specifications
- [ ] Handle error states according to design system
- [ ] Include accessibility features
- [ ] Follow Tailwind utility patterns

### Error Handling
- [ ] Implement error boundaries around feature
- [ ] Add retry logic for network requests
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Log errors appropriately
- [ ] Handle offline scenarios
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Use error state patterns from UX docs

### Loading States
- [ ] Add skeleton loaders for initial load
- [ ] Show loading indicators for actions
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates where appropriate
- [ ] Handle partial loading states
- [ ] Provide feedback for long-running operations
- [ ] Follow skeleton patterns from component template

### Type Safety
- [ ] Use strict TypeScript types (no `any`)
- [ ] Share types between frontend and backend
- [ ] Add zod validation for API responses
- [ ] Document complex type definitions
- [ ] Use proper type narrowing

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for business logic
- [ ] Add integration tests for API calls
- [ ] Include E2E tests for critical paths
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Test loading states
- [ ] Verify offline behavior
- [ ] Test accessibility features

### Accessibility
- [ ] Add proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation
- [ ] Check color contrast
- [ ] Test with screen readers
- [ ] Handle focus management
- [ ] Support user preferences (reduced motion, etc.)
- [ ] Follow accessibility patterns from UX docs

### Documentation
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for components
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Update architecture decisions if needed
- [ ] Include usage examples
- [ ] Document known limitations
- [ ] Update UX documentation if patterns change

- [ ] Follows widget specifications
- [ ] Uses correct Tailwind patterns
- [ ] Matches component template structure

### Performance
- [ ] Lazy loads where appropriate
- [ ] Implements proper caching
- [ ] Optimizes API calls
- [ ] Handles large datasets
- [ ] Monitors key metrics

### Security
- [ ] Implements rate limiting
- [ ] Sanitizes inputs

- [ ] Protects sensitive data

## Deployment Checklist

### Monitoring
- [ ] Add error tracking
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerts
- [ ] Log important events
- [ ] Track usage metrics

### Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Document configuration changes
- [ ] Update deployment guides
- [ ] Note any breaking changes
- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Update UX documentation if needed

## Definition of Done
A feature is only considered "done" when:
1. All applicable checklist items are completed
2. Code review is approved
3. Tests are passing
4. Documentation is updated
5. Monitoring is in place
6. UX review is completed
7. Accessibility is verified
8. Component follows UX standards and patterns

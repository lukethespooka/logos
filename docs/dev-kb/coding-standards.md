# Coding Standards

This document defines the coding standards for the LogOS project. All code generated by `@dev` must pass checks based on these standards, and `@qa` must enforce them during review.

## General Principles
- **Clarity over cleverness:** Code should be easy to read and understand.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Abstract reusable logic into functions or components.
- **Strict Typing:** Use TypeScript for all new code. Avoid `any` wherever possible.

## TypeScript & React
- **Component Naming:** Components should be PascalCase (e.g., `DailyBriefWidget.tsx`).
- **Hooks:** Custom hooks should be prefixed with `use` (e.g., `useAuth.ts`).
- **Props:** Use interfaces for component props, prefixed with `I` (e.g., `IDailyBriefWidgetProps`).
- **File Structure:** Feature-based folder structure as defined in the blueprint (`/features/<name>/`).

## Linting
- **ESLint:** The `.eslintrc` configuration in the root directory is the single source of truth for linting rules.
- **Max Lines:** A strict 250-line limit per file is enforced, with exemptions only for configuration, generated types, and test fixtures. [[memory:3882515615031388418]]
- **CI Gate:** All code must pass `pnpm run lint` with zero warnings before being merged.

## Naming Conventions
- **Variables:** camelCase (e.g., `dailyBriefData`).
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_BASE_URL`).
- **Functions:** camelCase (e.g., `fetchDailyBrief`).
- **CSS Classes:** Use Tailwind CSS utility classes. Avoid custom CSS files where possible.

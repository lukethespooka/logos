# Sprint 2.5 Plan: UX Polish & Interaction Refinement

**Sprint Goal:** Enhance the dashboard's user experience with polished animations, intelligent context awareness, and refined interactions while maintaining high accessibility standards.

**Timeline:** Week 7 - Week 8

## User Stories

### Story 1: As Alex, I want smooth, delightful interactions so the interface feels responsive and engaging.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Checkbox interactions have a spring animation when toggled
- Badge counts pulse briefly when updated
- Loading states use smooth skeleton animations
- State transitions (show/hide/update) use fade animations
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

**Tasks:**
- **`@dev`**: Create a shared animation utilities module
- **`@dev`**: Implement spring animation for checkbox interactions
- **`@dev`**: Add pulse animation for badge updates
- **`@dev`**: Create skeleton components with smooth animations
- **`@dev`**: Add fade transitions for state changes
- **`@qa`**: Test animations in various states and reduced-motion mode

### Story 2: As Alex, I want the Context Ribbon to proactively help me stay productive.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- "Plan My Day" button analyzes tasks and schedule to suggest a daily plan
- "Start Focus Timer" implements a customizable Pomodoro timer
- Context Ribbon learns from usage patterns to show relevant actions
- Suggestions are contextual based on time of day and current workload

**Tasks:**
- **`@dev`**: Implement Pomodoro timer functionality
- **`@dev`**: Create daily planning algorithm
- **`@dev`**: Add usage pattern tracking
- **`@dev`**: Implement contextual suggestion logic
- **`@qa`**: Verify timer accuracy and suggestion relevance

### Story 3: As Alex, I want clear feedback for all widget states so I always know what's happening.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each widget has a proper loading skeleton
- Error states show clear messages with retry options
- Empty states provide helpful guidance
- State changes are visually clear and smooth
- Interactive elements have distinct hover/focus states

**Tasks:**
- **`@dev`**: Create consistent loading skeletons for each widget
- **`@dev`**: Implement error handling with retry UI
- **`@dev`**: Design and implement empty states
- **`@dev`**: Add hover/focus states for interactive elements
- **`@qa`**: Test all possible widget states and transitions

### Story 4: As Alex, I want the dashboard to be fully accessible so I can use it with any input method.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All widgets have proper ARIA labels and roles
- Dynamic updates are announced via live regions
- Keyboard navigation follows a logical flow
- Focus indicators are clearly visible
- Screen reader announcements are meaningful and concise

**Tasks:**
- **`@dev`**: Add ARIA labels and roles to all widgets
- **`@dev`**: Implement live regions for dynamic content
- **`@dev`**: Enhance keyboard navigation
- **`@dev`**: Add screen reader announcements
- **`@qa`**: Perform thorough accessibility testing

### Story 5: As Alex, I want intelligent widget behavior so my dashboard adapts to my needs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Widgets track interaction patterns
- Most-used features are more prominent
- Widgets remember user preferences
- Dashboard layout can be customized
- Widget visibility can be toggled

**Tasks:**
- **`@dev`**: Implement widget interaction tracking
- **`@dev`**: Add widget preference persistence
- **`@dev`**: Create widget visibility controls
- **`@dev`**: Add drag-and-drop layout customization
- **`@qa`**: Test preference persistence and layout customization

## Technical Considerations

### Animation Performance
- Use CSS transforms and opacity for smooth animations
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- Debounce rapid state changes
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for complex animations

### Accessibility Requirements
- Support WCAG 2.1 Level AA
- Test with major screen readers
- Ensure keyboard-only navigation
- Maintain color contrast ratios

### State Management
- Use React Query for server state
- Implement local storage for preferences
- Add optimistic updates for all actions
- Handle edge cases and error states

## Sprint Review Goals
- All animations are smooth and performant
- Context Ribbon provides intelligent assistance
- Widgets handle all states gracefully
- Dashboard is fully accessible
- User preferences persist across sessions
